# Friends List App

Hello my name is Daniel Curda. I'm following a tutorial by John Elder (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg&list=WL&index=13&t=802s ).

I spend 2 solid weeks coding a user login and then I went throught his tutorial and had one up in about an hour :|

I DO have some issues with the new-user creation, but I suspect it's my installation. I am also unable to delete friends. I'm not sure what I've done with this one.

All of that said, I doubt I will spend much more time on this, but I do plan on converting some of my other projects to ruby on rails for more practice.
